== Chapter 10: Fermat Money Management

Monetary transactions in Fermat are handled separating the *transport of value* (that follows a specific _work-flow_) from the money accountancy, and all this is separated from the transmission of the additional information of the transaction ( the meta data ). +
Usually transactions start in specialized Plug-ins of one of the transaction layers, and the workflow chain of actions reach different levels, from consuming services of the lower layers such as the _Blockchain superlayer_ , connecting with the *crypto networks*, to the high level GUI components. The process interacts with Fermat's _vaults_ in the _Crypto Currency Platform_ to record the value, and contacts the *wallet* component to do the accountancy. + 
The rest of the information of the transaction is not related to the value, but transmitted through the different _network services_ through the Fermat Network which allows *meta data* to reach the GUI components and be displayed to the end user in a comprehensive way. +
This starts in the originating device and then - value and meta data - both flow to meet at the recipient's device activating the counterpart Plug-ins to record everything accordingly and validate the transaction.
