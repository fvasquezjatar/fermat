== Chapter 12: Fermat Crypto Currency Platform
This platform introduces the first *niche wallets* to manage existing crypto currencies - Bitcoin Wallet, Litecoin Wallet, Ripple Wallet, etc - and also the resources to develop new crypto currencies wallets invented later on in the future. + 

The new identities introduced in this platform are: +
[horizontal]
Intra-Crypto-Wallet-User identity :: +
Extra-Crypto-Wallet-User identity :: +

For a *niche wallet* to run, we need _reference wallets_ and underlying Plug-ins that grant: +

. User identification 
. Device identification
. Crypto network services 
. Crypto address management (address-book)
. Network services 
. World services (to access exchange rates, non-Fermat wallets, etc.)
. Transaction management 

=== New components
Some of the new components added to the framework by this platform are those that offer the following functionalities:

* Crypto address management, crypto money requests and crypto money transmission
* Consulting of crypto currency indexes 
* Crypto money transactions
* Bitcoin Wallet
* Bitcoin Loss Protected Wallet

=== Bitcoin Wallet
Fermat's Bitcoin *Niche Wallet*  is a _basic wallet_ in terms of its functionalities, even simpler than other popular BTC wallets on the market. This is so, to maximize its ulterior reutilization. + 
This wallet provides the minimum functionalities necessary to perform these Bitcoin transactions successfully: +

* Make a payment in BTC (send value to a BTC Wallet owner)
* Receive payments in BTC
* Show transactions 
* Show wallet balance 
* Show a basic contacts list (user-name and crypto address related to each contact)

////
The wallet prompts the user to provide a *password* ( or *pass-phrase* ) on first run. Then it generates a pair of private key/public Key for him, and derived from it, a valid _bitcoin address_ and the QR-Code image associated with it.
When the user decides to send a payment, he entered the amount and chooses the destination among the addresses stored in the contact's list, the wallet software creates a transaction with the valid format of a bitcoin transaction, it signs the transaction with the wallet's user unique digital signature (derived from his private/public key), and sends it to the bitcoin network to be propagated among the active nodes and when it is confirmed by others, it becomes part of the blockchain. When the transaction is confirmed by a mining node, it is written inside a transaction block of a new bitcoin blockchain's block. +
At this stage, the BTC amount was really "spent" i.e. transfered from the wallet's user to the destination user.  
The wallet will then show its up-dated balance, and also the successful transaction in the wallet's transaction's log.
////

NOTE: the simplicity of this wallet is maximized, it does NOT handle payments or money requests and  _whether_ it is interconnected with other wallets it _does not_ show anything else but plain BTC currency (no FIAT money abstraction!)

=== Bitcoin Loss Protected Wallet 
This is the second *Niche Wallet* developed by Fermat, and its main goal is to protect the user from losing money when attempting to spend 
Bitcoins at a price lower than the price when that Bitcoin amount was first purchased (or entered the wallet). +
The new functionalities include:

* Storing the *exchange rate* when a BTC amount is received in the wallet
* Checking the *exchange rate* when the user attempts to spend an amount of BTC and freeze the funds if they are below the *purchased price*
