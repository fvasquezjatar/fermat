== Chapter 11: Fermat Digital Assets Management

=== What is a Digital Asset?

A Digital Asset is a digital representation of a product or service that can be obtained in exchange of the asset. Another way of saying this, is that it is a representation of something of value that comes with a "right to use" for the asset's possessor. (The asset can be *redeemed* and the end user gets the product or service represented by it) + 
To create a digital asset two main components are needed:
 
the asset meta-data :: a set of information of what is represented by the asset and the conditions attached to it (*asset contract*)
the validation code :: a method that proves that the asset is genuine and that it cannot be duplicated or forged+
Fermat incorporates the management of Digital Assets over crypto, being the crypto component what ensures its authenticity among other very useful features granted by using blockchain technology. +
The application of Digital Assets is as wide as the digital world. There are some asset types that are familiar and some that may sound like sci-fi. +

=== Fermat Digital Assets
Other Digital Assets over crypto implementations available in the market are dependent on the crypto currency chosen ( Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, etc) but thanks to Fermat infrastructural connectivity to several crypto networks, Fermat Digital Assets can be issued in different crypto currencies. The whole set of Digital Asset functionalities to handle in Fermat are provided by _Fermat Digital Assets Platform_, and from it a new whole branch on _platforms based in digital assets_ is created. The first application is taken by _Fermat Marketing Platform_ which focuses on applications for the Marketing Agencies world.
